# Welcome!

## Preface
This is my solution for a ToDo app. 
If you look at my part 1, you'll notice that it's a
significant improvement both in terms of UI design and
functionality.

## Controls

### Add
To add a task item, just enter the details into the
***Task Details*** box. Now enter a date using the
***Date Picker*** to the left of the box. By default, it's set
to the current day. Now, just hit ***Add*** and presto,
your item is added!

### Remove
If you wish to remove an item, simply highlight it by clicking on it,
or clicking on one item, then using the **up** and **down** arrow keys while holding
down the **shift** key to select multiple. Then, click the *arrow* in the
***Add*** box and click ***Remove***.

### Edit
To edit a task in the list, just double-click the desired data field to start editing,
then hit ***Enter*** to save the changes.

### Mark as Complete
To mark an item as complete, click the ***Arrow Box*** to the right of the
item.

### Show/Hide
To show only a specific kind of item, click the ***Show/Hide*** menu button at 
the top left of the window, then click the desired item type. You can choose
between **All**, **Complete Only**, and **Incomplete Only**.

### Save/Load
To save or load a list of tasks, click the **File** menu button at the top 
left of the window, then click the desired operation. **Save** with prompt you
with a window to input the *name* of the file. Don't worry about the file extension, 
the name is always appended with the *.txt* extension.

For loading, simply pick the file you want to load with the *.txt* that was generated
by the app.
